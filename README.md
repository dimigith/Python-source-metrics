# Python Source Metrics

A tool that analyses a Python's project source files and calculate useful metrics and graphs. 
The main goal of the metrics is to reflect information about the structure of the code, the dependencies and 
also the relations of the objects it contains such as modules and classes. This could help on improving the 
quality of the code, fix vulnerable design choices and clean the codebase. 

## How to use
After cloning this project, change to `Python-source-metrics` directory and run `docker-compose up`. Then open the
following URL `http://localhost:5001/`.
